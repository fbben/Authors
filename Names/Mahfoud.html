    <strong>Nadjib Mahfoud</strong> is an Egyptian writer who won the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature. Mahfoud is
    regarded as one of the first contemporary writers in Arabic literature, along with Taha Hussein, to explore themes
    of existentialism. All of his novels take place in Egypt, and always mentions the lane, which equals the world. His
    most famous works include <em>The Cairo Trilogy</em> and <em>Children of Gebelawi.</em> While Mahfoud's literature is classified as
    realist literature, existential themes appear in it.
