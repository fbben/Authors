<i> <small>Portrait of Fyodor Dostoyevsky by Vasily Perov c. 1872.</small></i>
<p>
    <strong>Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky</strong> was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist and journalist.
    Numerous literary critics regard him as one of the greatest novelists in all of world literature, as many of his
    works are considered highly influential masterpieces. Dostoevsky's literary works explore the human condition in
    the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of
    philosophical and religious themes.

    His most acclaimed novels include <em>Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), and The
        Brothers
        Karamazov (1880).</em> His 1864 novella <em>Notes from Underground</em> is considered to be one of the first
    works of
    existentialist literature.
